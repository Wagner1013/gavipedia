        <div>
            <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
            <p>The <b>Abolition Movement</b> was a group of people 
                who pushed for the total freedom and immediate 
                emancipation of enslaved people in America. 
                The <b>Abolition Movement</b> also believed that 
                slave owners shouldn’t have to be paid or 
                reimbursed for their lost slaves which they 
                considered property.</p>

            <h2><u>Dates of Activity</u></h2>
            <p>The <b>Abolition Movement</b> started in the 
                <b>late 1700s</b> and ended when slavery became 
                illegal and all slaves were set free in the 
                year <b>1865</b>.

            <h2><u>Important Leaders</u></h2>
            <p><b>William Lloyd Garrison</b> was a white man 
                from the north. In Boston, he founded 
                a newspaper called <i>The Liberator</i> in 1831. 
                The newspaper contained anti-slavery views 
                and became one of the most influential 
                abolitionist media outputs in the United 
                States.</p>

            <p><b>Frederick Douglass</b> was a slave until he 
                escaped at the age of 20 in 1838. After Douglass 
                reached freedom in the north, he helped other 
                slaves escape their cruel masters. Douglass 
                also published a newspaper called <i>The North 
                Star</i> which shared anti-slavery ideas similar 
                to what <i>The Liberator</i> was doing. In 1845, 
                Douglass published his autobiography called 
                <i>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, 
                an American Slave</i>. Frederick Douglass gave 
                speeches about the cruelty of slavery and became 
                a notable leader of the movement.</p>

            <p><b>Harriet Tubman</b>, a former slave who had 
                escaped her owner, was a conductor on the 
                Underground Railroad. The Underground Railroad 
                was a system of abolitionists who helped get 
                people out of slavery and up into the north 
                where they would be free. Tubman helped over 
                300 people escape slavery.</p>

            <h2><u>Reforms Sought Out</u></h2>
            <p>The <b>Abolition Movement</b> sought complete freedom 
                for all enslaved people in the United States. 
                They also wanted to make sure that former slave 
                owners didn’t receive any compensation for 
                losing their slaves.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Significant Dates</u></h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1804</b> - All states north of Maryland have abolished slavery. Only the southern states still allow slavery.</li>
                <li><b>1831</b> - William Lloyd Garrison founded his abolition newspaper, <i>The Liberator</i>.</li>
                <li><b>1845</b> - Frederick Douglass published his autobiography entitled, <i>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave</i>, which shares his life story and the terrors of slavery.</li>
                <li><b>1863</b> - The Emancipation Proclamation is signed by President Abraham Lincoln, freeing all slaves in the rebellious states.</li>
                <li><b>1865</b> - The 13th Amendment is passed making all slavery and involuntary servitude illegal.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Legislation Changes</u></h2>
            <p>The <b>Abolition Movement</b> received a big win when 
                <b>President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation 
                Proclamation</b>. This proclamation stated that all 
                slaves in the rebellious states were free. The 
                Emancipation Proclamation led the way for the 
                creation and <b>ratification of the 13th Amendment</b> 
                which officially set all slaves in the United 
                States free and prohibited any further slavery 
                or involuntary servitude.</p>

            <h2><u>Summary and Impact</u></h2>
            <p>Slavery was a sad part of our nation’s history, 
                but thanks to the bold efforts of the <b>Abolition 
                Movement</b>, slavery is no longer a prominent 
                part of our society. The <b>Abolition Movement</b> 
                helped the United States redefine the phrase 
                “All men are created equal” because at the time 
                this phrase only applied to white men. Now this 
                phrase applies to all people in the United States 
                no matter race, ethnicity, or gender.
