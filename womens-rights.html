            <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
            <p>Before the <b>Women’s Rights movement</b>, women were 
                expected to remain at home and do chores. Women 
                could not go to college or university, they could 
                not own land, and they could not vote. When women 
                started helping fight for the rights of others, 
                many of them realized they did not have rights 
                themselves. The <b>Women’s Rights Movement</b> believed 
                in equality for all regardless of gender.</p>

            <h2><u>Dates of Activity</u></h2>
            <p>The first organized <b>Women’s Rights movement 
                started in 1848</b>, however, the idea started 
                in 1840 when Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady 
                Stanton were denied the right to speak at the 
                World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The 
                fight for women’s rights <b>ended around the time 
                the 19th Amendment</b>, allowing women to vote, 
                was ratified.</p>

            <p><b>Lucretia Mott</b> was an abolitionist who was 
                fighting to free slaves. In 1840, she 
                attended the World Anti-Slavery Convention, 
                however when she tried to speak, she was 
                rejected simply because she was a woman. 
                Upon returning home, she began to campaign 
                for women’s rights, and in 1848, she worked 
                with <b>Elizabeth Cady Stanton</b> and organized 
                the first woman's rights convention in Seneca 
                Falls, New York. Throughout her life, she 
                continued to fight for women’s rights. She was 
                a true pioneer for women’s rights.</p>

            <p><b>Susan B. Anthony</b>, like many other women’s 
                rights activists, started as an abolitionist. 
                She had met with <b>William Lloyd Garrison</b> and 
                <b>Frederick Douglass</b> and was moved by their 
                stories and became a big activist. Giving 
                speeches and fighting for the freedom of slaves.

                two traveled the US delivering speeches on 
                equality even though they risked being arrested 
                for sharing their opinions in public. Anthony 
                later co-founded the American Equal Rights 
                Association and the National Woman Suffrage 
                Association. <b>Susan B. Anthony</b> will be remembered
