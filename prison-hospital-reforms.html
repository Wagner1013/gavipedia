        <h1 class="title">Prison And Hospital Reforms</h1>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
            <p>At the beginning of the 1800s, prisons were 
                overcrowded and unsanitary and people with 
                mental illnesses were mistreated and harmed. 
                Children and adults were being jailed together, 
                while people with mental illnesses were chained 
                up and locked in cages. <b>Prison and hospital 
                reform</b> was necessary for troubled people to 
                become members of society.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Dates of Activity</u></h2>
            <p>People began to notice the poor treatment of inmates 
                <b>around the 1820s</b>. Throughout the 19th century, 
                reformers worked to improve the life of prisoners 
                so that they are safe but still serving time in 
                prison. On the mental illness side, people noticed 
                the poor treatment of the mentally ill in the early 
                1800s. <b>Reformers worked through the 1880s</b> to help 
                create mental institutions where the mentally ill 
                are cared for.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Important Leaders</u></h2>
            <p><b>Dorthea Dix</b> was an activist that spoke out about 
                the mistreatment of prisoners, especially the mistreatment 
                of the mentally ill. She petitioned for better treatment 
                of prisoners and taught Sunday School at prisons. She also 
                was able to convince people that it was not wrong to be 
                mentally ill. She helped improve the lives of many people.</p>

            <h2><u>Reforms Sought Out</u></h2>
            <p><b>Prison reformers wanted to make sure that common 
                problems such as overcrowding, lack of food, and 
                abuse were being fixed</b>. Prison reformers 
                thought that even though prisoners had broken 
                the law, they should still be treated like humans. 
                Hospital and <b>mental health reformers wanted to 
                make sure that people who suffered from mental 
                illnesses weren’t being chained up, neglected, 
                and beaten just because they may not be fully 
                mentally capable</b>. They wanted the mentally ill 
                to be cared for and have access to places like 
                mental institutions where they can get help for 
                their conditions.</p>

            <h2><u>Legislation Changes</u></h2>
            <p>The Prison reformers were able to get <b>Massachusetts 
                to outlaw the death penalty in 1847. Rhode Island 
                followed by outlawing the death penalty in 1852</b>. 
                There weren’t many more laws that changed the 
                prison system, however, the construction of two 
                new prisons, the Auburn Prison and the Eastern 
                State Penitentiary, led to a change in the prison 
                system. Massachusetts led the charge again by 
                creating legislation to help people with mental 
                illness. A man named Reverend Louis Dwight started 
                an organization called Boston Prison Discipline Society 
                in 1825 that pushed for the creation of these laws. 
                This organization worked to improve the conditions 
                of prisoners and the mentally ill and had a great 
                impact.</p>

            <h2><u>Summary and Impact</u></h2>
            <p>Thanks to the work of prison and hospital reformers, 
                the lives of America’s inmates and the mentally 
                ill were greatly improved in the 1800s. Instead 
                of being packed together and abused in our prison 
                system, inmates now have an environment where they 
                can reflect on their mistakes and become better 
                members of society. The work of reformers for the 
                benefit of the mentally ill was a huge success in 
                the sense that people with those issues are no longer 
                abused and chained up. Instead, they are helped and 
                cared for by workers in places like mental institutions.</p>
