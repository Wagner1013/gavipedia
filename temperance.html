        <h1 class="title">The Temperance Movement</h1>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
            <p>In the 1800s, alcohol abuse was widespread across the United States and it was leading to the separation of families, crime, and mental illness. The <b>Temperance Movement</b> was created to stop the sale and consumption of alcohol.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Dates of Activity</u></h2>
            <p>The <b>Temperance movement</b> was active from the early 1800s to the repealment of the 18th Amendment (National Prohibition Act) in 1933.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Important Leaders</u></h2>
            <p><b>Carry Nation</b> was an activist for the 
                <b>Temperance Movement</b>. When she was 
                young, she married a physician named 
                Charles Glyod; however, she divorced him 
                a few months later due to his severe 
                alcoholism. She joined the <b>Temperance 
                Movement</b> in 1890 after the Supreme Court 
                ruled in favor of liquor sales. She earned 
                the nickname “Hatchet Granny” because she 
                would go into places of liquor sales and 
                smash things.</p>

            <h2><u>Significant Dates</u></h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1808</b> - The first Temperance organization was created in Saratoga, New York.</li>
                <li><b>1833</b> - There are more than 6,000 local temperance organizations in The United States.</li>
                <li><b>1842</b> - Over one million people in the Washingtonian Temperance Society are pledged to stay away from alcohol.</li>
                <li><b>1851</b> - Maine is the first state in the Union to ban the production and sale of alcohol.</li>
                <li><b>1851-1855</b> - 12 states banned the manufacturing and sale of liquor.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Legislation Changes</u></h2>
            <p><b>The Temperance Movement</b> sought the 
                ban of the movement, sale, and manufacturing 
                of liquor in the US. They achieved this goal 
                in 1919 when the 18th Amendment was passed 
                and banned all of these actions. However, 
                the <b>18th Amendment</b> was repealed in 1933 
                allowing the production and distribution of 
                liquor to continue.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Summary and Impact</u></h2>
            <p>In the end, the <b>Temperance Movement</b> brought 
                awareness to the fact that alcohol abuse 
                was a big problem in society. Even though 
                the movement wasn’t successful in sustaining 
                a nationwide ban on alcohol, it led to the 
                creation of programs like AA and SADD that 
                help people reform their lives today.
