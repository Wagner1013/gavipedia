        <div>
            <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
            <p>Education in America used to be for the rich and 
                the elite. However, the <b>Education Reform movement</b> 
                helped give all kids access to education and 
                helped get kids out of child labor situations.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Dates of Activity</u></h2>
            <p>The <b>Education Reform movement</b> started in the <b>early 
                1800s</b> when reformers agreed that education should 
                be available and free to everyone in the U.S. The 
                movement ended state by state as each state began 
                building common schools and passing laws requiring 
                kids to go to school. The last state to make it 
                mandatory for children to attend school was Mississippi 
                in <b>1917</b>. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Important Leaders</u></h2>
            <p><b>Horace Mann</b> was an activist for public education. 
                He was appointed Secretary of the Massachusetts 
                Board of Education in 1837. His philosophy was 
                that for a democratic society to function, its 
                citizens must be educated. He advocated for 
                government-funded schools that children were 
                required to attend. He is known as the father 
                of American education for efforts.</p>

            <h2><u>Reforms Sought Out</u></h2>
            <p>Education reformers wanted education to be 
                available to everyone, so they started to 
                push for places like public schools to be 
                opened. Many reformers wanted schools to be 
                funded by the government. Other reformers also 
                wanted it to be mandatory by law for kids to 
                attend school.</p>

            <h2><u>Significant Dates</u></h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1837</b> - Horace Mann is appointed the Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education and begins campaigning for common, government schools.</li>
                <li><b>1852</b> - Massachusetts is the first state to make it mandatory for children to attend school.</li>
                <li><b>1853</b> - Every northern state has a common school.</li>
                <li><b>1917</b> - Mississippi is the last state to make common school mandatory for kids.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><u>Legislation Changes</u></h2>
            <p><b>While there is no national law requiring children 
                to attend school, every state in the U.S. 
                requires children to go to school</b>. Every 
                child in every state has access to public 
                education or private education if their parents 
                wish. However, one of these is required.</p>

        <div>
            <h2><u>Summary and Impact</u></h2>
            <p>The <b>Education Reform Movement</b> was massively 
                important when it came to getting kids out 
                of factories and providing them with a solid 
                education. Thanks to reformers like Horace Mann, 
                generations now can be educated to become useful 
                to society and contribute to America’s democracy. </p>
